Promoter melting initiates in PIC with MTF1 trapping the -4 to -2 non-template (NT) bases in its NT-groove. Transition to IC is marked by a large-scale movement that aligns the template with RNA at the active site. RNA synthesis scrunches the NT strand into an NT-loop, which interacts with centrally positioned MTF1 C-tail. Steric clashes of the C-tail with RNA:DNA and NT-loop, and dynamic scrunching- unscrunching of DNA explain abortive synthesis and transition into elongation. Capturing the catalytically active IC-state with UTPaS poised for incorporation enables modeling toxicity of antiviral nucleosides/nucleotides\n",

       "\"The outbreak of infectious diseases has always been one of the most important health problems in the world. With the rapid spread of the new coronavirus (COVID- 19) , much attention has been paid to subjects like rate of an epidemic, transition ways, prevention methods, and remaining time of the virus in the environment [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Therefore, the behavior of the virus in relation to environmental factors is critical. The coronavirus is one of the epidemic diseases that many countries have experienced in the new type of it, COVID-19, and can become a serious challenge and affect the previous efforts on sustainable development [6] [7] [8] [9] .It has been found that there are some delays between the detection of confirmed cases and the actual infection date due to the laboratory test, the time of the announcement of confirmed cases in media, and the time for the patients showing initial symptoms for a total usually of 3 to 5 days [10] [11] [12] . The analysis of Kampf et al. (2020) demonstrated that COVID-19 could remain up to 9 days on different materials based on temperature and humidity [13] . Cascella et al. (2020) conducted research on the new coronavirus structure. Their analysis shows that the virus belongs to the family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ ssRNA), which has a length of about 30 kb and an envelope with spear structures and they tested the sensitivity of the virus to UV and temperature [14] . investigated the correlations between environmental factors and the number of positive cases of COVID-19 by the use of artificial intelligence techniques. The results of this study put evidence on the role of urban and weather conditions on the epidemic rate [15] . Chen et al. (2020) developed a time-dependent mathematical model for the prediction of the total number of positive cases [16] . Lytle and Sagripanti (2005) studied the impact of UV rays, and their results determined that it can affect the structure of coronaviruses because UV rays could damage the nucleic acids of viral RNA that is vital for the survival of the virus [17] . developed an assessment method for investigating the impact of climate and urban factors in confirmed cases of COVID-19 [18] . Bukhari et al., (2020) , studied the epidemic of COVID-19 on tropical zones and their results show that the highest number of infection happened in temperature among 3 to 17 ºC [19] .The analysis of Grant and Giovannucci (2009) shows that by increasing the UV, the level of vitamin D in the body increases and makes the infection rates decrease. Therefore, in areas on lower latitudes and closer to the equator line, the epidemic on COVID-19 might be different [20] . In the study of Chan et al. (2011) , the effect of temperature and humidity on SARS coronavirus was analyzed, and they found that increasing temperature decreases the epidemic rate by faster disabling virus structure on contaminated surfaces [21] . Pirouz and Violini (2020) , analyzed the outbreak patterns of COVID-19 by analysis of 117 countries. They suggested two mechanisms of triggering the development of the infection, namely the normal spread of an infection from one parent case and the consequence of a unique phenomenon of accumulation of contagious people [22] . Analysis of the previous studies demonstrates the necessity of further research about the effect of environmental factors on the COVID-19. Since some of the previous researches have shown the effect of weather conditions, especially temperature, on coronavirus viruses, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the better correlation of daily mean air temperature on the epidemic rate of the COVID-19.In this study, we analysed the number of positive contagions of coronavirus COVID-19, from February 29 th to March 19 th . The selection of February 29 th is due to existence on this date of at least one positive case of COVID-19 in all case studies studied. The analysis of the weather data started from February15 th and ended on March 18 th because the impact of the weather parameter would occur in the upcoming days. Thus, the considered average daily temperature is with an interval of 1 to 14 days before the definitive cases of COVID-19.\\uf0b7 In order to minimize the impact of other parameters on the results, such as the policy of each government, cultural differences between countries, health care systems, or the protocols in getting coronavirus test, comparative analysis have been done for different regions of the same country, without comparing with each other the results of different countries; \\uf0b7 The analysis period for average daily temperature ranges from February15 th , 2020 to March18 th , 2020 (33 days); \\uf0b7 The analysis period for confirmed cases of coronavirus COVID-19 is from February 29 th to March19 th ; \\uf0b7 For what concerns the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, the total number of confirmed cases in a region was divided into the population of that region in order to take into account the different size of the population in each region.To carry out the analysis, the datasets of five countries and in each country, of three regions/provinces have been considered. The selected case studies are presented in Table 1 . and the location of the three regions shown in Figures 1. Mathematical models have been successfully used for the analysis of many hazards [32, 33] . In complex subjects, different Mathematical models can be used to solve the problem [34] [35] [36] . Statistical tests are an appropriate method for the investigation of possible correlations between different datasets [37] . Many statistical tests can be used for the analysis of significant differences between the datasets, among which F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test [38] .In order to investigate the hypothesis about a correlation between significant differences (Sig.) of average daily temperatures and average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases in two regions, the following assumptions, and statistical tests have been done:\\uf0b7 The variances of the two groups are equal: H0 \\uf0b7 The variances of the two groups are not equal: H1.

Conversely, if the significance level (sig.) is larger than 0.05, the hypothesis H1 is rejected, and the hypothesis H0 is accepted, i.e., the variances of the datasets in the two selected regions are equal.Through F-test, one determines the presence or absence of differences in the variances of the two regions. Through another statistical test, the Independent-Samples T-Test, one can determine whether the difference is significant, has been used. When using Independent-Samples T-Test, a significance level (sig.) lower (higher) than 0.05, means that the difference is (is not) significant.In our analysis, we used SPSS software. The critical factors in the SPSS Model set up are as follow:\\uf0b7 The datasets in different regions of the same countries were analyzed with respect to the average daily air temperature during the 33-day period from 15-Feb to 18-Mar and the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the 19 days from 29-Feb to 19-Mar. \\uf0b7 In all statistical tests, the confidence level of 95% is considered. \\uf0b7 First, the F-test was used to test whether there is a significant equality of variances for each pair of case studies, and then, depending on the F-test result, by the T-Test the existence of a significant difference between the data of the two cases was investigated.The average daily temperature [39, 40] , and cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases [41] , are shown in Figures 2 to 6.a. Average daily temperature b. Cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases Correlations between the average temperatures and the cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases were found especially for towns with significant differences, with respect to the other two towns of the same country, in the average daily temperature. This was the case for Bandar Abas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. The average daily temperature and cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases are listed in Table 2 . As a general feature of Table 2 , we notice that \\uf0b7 In 11 out of the possible fifteen comparisons, the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is higher when the average daily temperature is lower, and in the four remaining cases the differences in either variable are small.A more specific analysis per country shows that \\uf0b7 In Iran, the average daily temperature in Bandar Abbas was the highest (21.54 ºC), and the average cumulative rate of daily of confirmed cases was the lowest (0.000027). .

However, the comparison of Santa Cruz with higher average daily temperatures shows a slower spread of COVID-19. \\uf0b7 In the United States, the average daily air temperature in both New York and Seattle are lower than Los Angeles, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases shows the spread of the virus in both is faster than in Los Angeles.These qualitative results reflect in the statistical analysis of the data by F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test presented in Table 3 .

From the F-test, the F value is equal to 20.4. The criterion for variance equality in the F-test is that the F value must smaller than the critical F value. The statistical analysis has been done on a statistical confidence level of 95%, and therefore the error level is 0.05, and considering the degrees of freedom, the critical F value of the test that can be found through F distribution tables [42] , in this case, is equal to F = 1.57. Since the F value we found is 20.4, larger than the critical F value, the assumption of the equality of variances is rejected. It means that the average temperature variance of the Ramsar and Tehran are not equal.According to the t-test, the t value for these two cities is equal to -1.929. Based on an error level of 0.05 and by considering the degrees of freedom, the critical values of the test indicated in the T distribution tables [43] , is in this case equal to t = ± 1.645. Since the t value is out of the critical boundary (-1.645 ≤ acceptable t ≤ +1.645), the assumption of equality in the averages is rejected, and the existence of difference in averages is confirmed. Thus from two tests, it is evident that there is a significant difference between the average temperature of the two cities of Ramsar and Tehran.An analogous result holds for the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases.The main results of Table 4 , with a confidence level of 95% are as follow:\\uf0b7 In Iran, the city of Bandar Abbas is significantly different from Ramsar and Tehran in terms of both average daily temperature and average cumulative rate of confirmed cases. \\uf0b7 In Italy, the city of Milan is significantly different from Rome and Naples in terms of both average daily temperature and average cumulative rate of confirmed cases. Instead, the two cities of Rome and Napoli are not significantly different in terms of these variables. \\uf0b7 In Germany, there are no significant differences in average daily temperature in all three cities, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is not significantly different. \\uf0b7 In Spain, Barcelona and Valencia are not significantly different in terms of average daily temperature, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases is not significantly different. However, in Barcelona and Santa Cruz, the average daily temperature is significantly different, as well as the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases, and the same trend exists between Valencia and Santa Cruz. \\uf0b7 In the United States, the two cities of New York and Seattle are not significantly different in terms of average daily temperature, and of the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases, the number of patients is not significantly different. Instead, the city of Los Angeles is significantly different in terms of average daily temperature with two cities of New York and Seattle, and the average cumulative rate of confirmed cases are different significantly.The results of our analysis of daily air temperature for three case studies from five countries showed the existence of correlations between the average temperatures and the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when the differences in average daily temperature are larger. For example, in Iran and Italy, the regions with lower average daily temperature had a higher epidemic level of the new coronavirus (COVID- 19) , and the same trend exists in all other case studies.The statistical analysis showed that in all the case studies we considered, referring to five different countries, if there is a significant difference in daily mean temperature, there is also a significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, supporting the proposed research hypothesis about the correlation between air temperature and the epidemic rates of COVID-19. Due to the correlations among temperature and hours of sunshine for future research, it is recommended to study the effects of the sun's UV rays as well as the average hours of sunshine on the epidemic rates of COVID-19.This study analyzed the possible correlation of daily average air temperature with the epidemic rate of the coronavirus (COVID-19) using significant differences analysis between the datasets. The research hypothesis is that in regions with a significant difference in the average daily temperature, the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases would also is different significantly. Conversely, to the absence of a significant difference in daily temperature, would correspond no significant difference in the rate of confirmed cases. The hypothesis was investigated through statistical analysis. In order to minimize the impact on the results of factors like the policy of the government or cultural differences among countries (food, exercise, weight, etc.), three case studies within five countries, namely Iran, Italy, Germany, Spain, and United States were compared separately. This comparison using statistical analysis through F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test of the daily temperatures and daily rate of confirmed cases shows that there is a correlation between the average temperature and the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when differences in average daily temperature are significantly larger, as it happens for Bandar Abbas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. Besides, the analysis of the average air temperatures shows that the epidemic rates of COVID-19 were higher in the case studies with a lower average temperature. Instead, when no significant differences exist in the average daily temperature of two cities in the same country, there is no significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. In conclusion, the results of this study support the research hypothesis and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for analysis of the epidemic rates..

Different studies have called the attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus, and in particular, the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the average daily temperature and the rate of coronavirus epidemic growth in the infected regions. The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature, a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature. To test this research hypothesis, we carried on the case study of three regions in each of five countries and analyzed the correlation through F-test, and Independent-Samples T-Test. In all five selected countries, we found that when there is a significant difference in the daily mean temperature between two regions of a country, a significant difference exists also in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases.

The research hypothesis is that in regions with a significant difference in the average daily temperature, the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases would also is different significantly. Conversely, to the absence of a significant difference in daily temperature, would correspond no significant difference in the rate of confirmed cases. The hypothesis was investigated through statistical analysis. In order to minimize the impact on the results of factors like the policy of the government or cultural differences among countries (food, exercise, weight, etc.), three case studies within five countries, namely Iran, Italy, Germany, Spain, and United States were compared separately. This comparison using statistical analysis through F-test and Independent-Samples T-Test of the daily temperatures and daily rate of confirmed cases shows that there is a correlation between the average temperature and the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when differences in average daily temperature are significantly larger, as it happens for Bandar Abbas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. Besides, the analysis of the average air temperatures shows that the epidemic rates of COVID-19 were higher in the case studies with a lower average temperature. Instead, when no significant differences exist in the average daily temperature of two cities in the same country, there is no significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. In conclusion, the results of this study support the research hypothesis and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for analysis of the epidemic rates.',\n",

In particular, they serve as carriers for the delivery of drugs, genetic materials, and antigens. “Colloidal metallic gold is not bio-inert”—such is the name Brown et al.\\n7 gave to their article so as to stress the importance of nanometer size in biological effects, even for such a seemingly inert material as gold.',\n",

       " {'text': 'It is natural to suppose that the first cells that GNPs encounter on their way in the mammalian organism are those of the immune system, in particular its phagocytic link (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and mast cells). Indeed, as early as in the first attempts to investigate colloidal gold biodistribution, which were performed in the 1960s–80s on rabbits,8 mice,9 and rats10,11 it was found that after parenteral administration, colloidal gold particles are captured by liver cells, excreted through bile, and eliminated from the organism with feces. After injection, gold was identified mostly in Kupffer cells. Perhaps Scott et al.\\n8 were the first to note that the phagocytosis of GNPs is size dependent. Besides Hardonk et al.,10 the important role of Kupffer cells in the elimination of GNPs was established by Sadauskas et al.,12 who injected GNPs intravenously in mice. Electron microscopy showed that after injection, the GNPs accumulated in the macrophages of the liver (90%) and spleen (10%). The authors concluded that GNPs penetrate only phagocytes, primarily the Kupffer cells of the liver. In a subsequent study,13 Sadauskas et al. reported that GNPs get localized in lysosomes (endosomes) of Kupffer cells and can be retained there for up to six months. The influence of size, solubility and surface modification on the biocompatibility of GNPs and their use in biological applications is well known.14,15 However, the effects of nanoparticle properties on the immune system are still being explored.',\n",

       " {'text': \"The immune system cells constitute the first barrier to nanoparticle penetration of animal tissues and cells. Therefore, the study of GNP interactions with phagocytes, the mechanisms of intracellular uptake, and the responses of immune cells to GNPs is undoubtedly of major interest. Perhaps the first detailed consideration of these issues can be found in Shukla et al.,16 who, using three microscopic methods, examined the uptake of 3 nm GNPs into RAW264.7 macrophage cells. The conclusion from their study was that small GNPs enter macrophages through pinocytosis and get localized mostly in lysosomes and in the perinuclear space. On the whole, Shukla et al.'s data indicate that the GNPs are biocompatible, noncytotoxic and nonimmunogenic and that they suppress the production of reactive oxygen species and do not cause elaboration of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL1-β (which contradicts the data of Yen et al.\\n17). In contrast to data by Shukla et al.,16 Yen et al.\\n17 noted that on the administration of GNPs, the number of macrophages decreases and their size increases, this being accompanied by elevated production of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α. We emphasize that the data of Shukla et al.\\n16 were obtained for very small (3 nm) particles. However, Lim et al.,18 using much larger (60 nm) hollow NSphs capped with dextran, and Zhang et al.,19 using 60 nm GNPs, achieved results similar to the findings of Shukla et al.\\n16 for the same cell culture. Sumbayev et al.\\n20 showed that citrate-stabilized GNPs specifically downregulate, in a size dependent manner, the cellular responses induced by IL-1β both in vitro and in vivo. In a recent study, Guevél et al.\\n21 demonstrated that 12 nm gold nanoparticles induce cell mediated responses accompanied by inflammatory natural killer (NK) cell stimulation, whereas 2 nm gold nanoparticles are more efficiently taken up without inducing dendritic cell maturation or lymphocyte proliferation. To summarize, the published data revealed strong effects of the GNP size and functionalization on production of proinflammatory cytokines.\",\n",

From their results, it follows that indeed, on entry into murine bone marrow macrophages, GNPs do not affect the production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, if the GNP surface is modified with the peptide AGIP (amyloid growth inhibitory peptide, LPFFD) or SAP [sweet arrow peptide, (VRLPPP)3], GNPs, on entry into the macrophages, involve the induction of NO synthase and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. In addition, they inhibit macrophage proliferation. The recognition of GNP–peptide conjugates was made more effective through toll-like receptors 4 (TLR-4) on the surface of the macrophages. Yet, Staroverov et al.\\n28,29 demonstrated that both 15 nm nonconjugated GNPs and their conjugates with high- and low-molecular-weight antigens, on entry into rat peritoneal macrophages, enhance their respiratory activity and the activity of macrophage mitochondrial enzymes (Fig. 1). GNPs also have greatly increased the production of IL-1, IL-6 and IFN-γ (Fig. 2).

In fact, it is the GNP–protein corona that forms the first nano–bio interface and determines the first interactions of GNPs with/or within living cells. This is because the GNP–protein corona is a dynamic biopolymer layer that can strongly affect cellular uptake owing to modification of the particle properties (the overall size, charge, etc.). Although as much as 69 plasma proteins can bind to the GNP surface,44,45 only some of them, such as albumin, apolipoprotein, immunoglobulin, complement and fibrinogen, are the most abundantly bound proteins forming the GNP–protein corona.

On the basis of their study, the mechanism of nanoparticle trapping can be classified as macropinocytosis rather than phagocytosis. Particle shape was found to affect strongly the particle trapping by cells of the immune system; specifically, CTAB-coated GNRs (50 × 15 nm) could be trapped faster than CTAB-coated 15 and 50 nm gold nanospheres. Replacing CTAB by poly(ethylene oxide) greatly reduced uptake effectiveness for both types of GNPs. Nanoparticle uptake by the immune cells was accompanied by an activation of the genes of proinflammatory cytokines and by a corresponding change in the cell phenotype. A characteristic fact is that the “professionally” phagocytic cells took up GNPs two orders of magnitude more effectively than did, e.g., HeLa cells.

This interest is mainly due to the physicochemical (nonspecific) theory of immunity proposed by J. Bordet, who postulated that immunogenicity, along with antigenic specificity, depends predominantly on the physicochemical properties of antigens, first of all on their colloidal state. L. A. Zilber made successful attempts to obtain agglutinating sera to colloidal gold76 (interestingly, a repeated attempt to prepare antisera to colloidal gold was performed almost 80 years later, in 2006).77 Yet, several authors have shown that the introduction of a complete antigen together with colloidal metals promotes the production of antibodies.78 Furthermore, some haptens may cause antibody production when adsorbed to colloidal particles.79 Numerous data on the influence of colloidal gold on nonspecific immune response are given in one of the best early reviews.80 In particular, it was noted that at 2 h after an intravenous injection of 5 mL of colloidal gold into rabbits, there was a sizable increase in total leucocytes in 1 mL of blood (from 10 000 to 19 800) against a slight decline in mononuclear cells (from 5200 to 4900) and a considerable increase in polynuclear cells (from 4700 to 14 900).81 On injection of other colloidal metals, no such phenomena were observed. Unfortunately, with advances in immunology and with denial of many postulates of Bordet's theory, interest in the immunological properties of colloids decreased. There is no doubt, though, that the data obtained on the enhancement of immune response to antigens adsorbed on colloidal particles were utilized for the development of various adjuvants.82,83\\n\",\n",

According to the current view,94 the presentation of an antigen to T cells is preceded by its processing, i.e., cleavage into peptide fragments followed by the formation of bonds with molecules of the major histocompatibility complex, which transport the antigen fragment to the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. It remains unclear, then, how this process can proceed with a hapten. The hypothesis of the multivalent antigen, i.e., the antigen formed because of the high local concentration of univalent antigens on the surface of a gold particle, does not answer this question either. Hypothetical mechanisms of the immunomodulatory effects of nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 8 and 9.234,235\\n',\n",

The activation of immune cells by GNPs, shown by several authors, may serve as a basis to develop new vaccine adjuvants. As in the case of the usual cells, interactions with various types of receptors on the surface of immune cells and, correspondingly, various types of GNP endocytosis depend largely on the surface functionalization of GNPs. Many researchers believe that the key role in macrophage uptake of GNPs is played by scavenger receptors. However, the interaction of functionalized GNPs with cells of the immune system is still far from being understood in more or less detail and requires further study.236\\n',\n",
